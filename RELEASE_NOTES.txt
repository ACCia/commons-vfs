2005-

filenames:
add a type (file/folder) to filename.
This is needed to allow URI style filename resolving
e.g. base "file:///path/to/file" with relative name "any/file" results in "file:///path/to/any/file" instead
of "file:///path/to/file/any/file"
This is experimental code. Switch on with "VFS.setUriStyle(true);" before ANY other VFS operation.

ant tasks:
added antlib.xml - (Jacob Kjome)

zip, jar, ....:
allow filenames without trailing "!"
allow createFilesystem with .gz files
better handling of file/folder flag with compressed files
