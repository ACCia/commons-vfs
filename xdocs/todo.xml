            <p>
              The following is a list of items that need to be completed.
              Contributions are welcome!.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>More documentation</li>
                <li>Add more providers: http, webdav, resources, tar, gzip, cvs, jndi, etc</li>
                <li>Formalise the provider API.</li>
                <li>The in-memory caching mechanism is pretty rudimentary at
                this stage. It needs work to make it size capped. In addition,
                some mechanism needs to be provided to release and refresh
                cached info.</li>
                <li>The on-disk caching mechanism also needs more work.  Needs
                to check last-modified time.  Replicator needs to be more
                configurable.</li>
                <li>Add persistent replicator.</li>
                <li>Add local mirroring.</li>
                <li>Change AbstractLayeredFileSystem to track changes to
                the parent file object.  Eg when the parent file is deleted,
                mark all the files in the fs as 'does-not-exist'.</li>
                <li>Change AbstractLayeredFileSystem to support writeable
                layered fs.</li>
                <li>Make StandardFileSystemManager configurable from an XML descriptor.</li>
                <li>Change the model so that folders may have content.</li>
                <li>Add support for junctions (ie links).</li>
                <li>Add support for federation (ie transparently crossing file
                system boundaries, such as drilling down into the contents
                of a Jar file).</li>
                <li>Add Filtering file systems, which sit on top of another
                file system, and alter the contents.  For example, gzip or bzip2.</li>
                <li>Add an equivalent of the fileScanner Jelly tag.</li>
                <li>Add an equivalent of Ant fileset.</li>
                <li>Allow selectors, name mappers, and filters to be specified
                for the Ant tasks.</li>
                <li>Capabilities discovery.</li>
                <li>Attributes and attribute schema.</li>
                <li>Handle file canonicalisation better (for cases like
                case-insensitive file systems, symbolic links, name mangling, etc).</li>
                <li>Add more selectors: XPath, Ant style, regular expression.</li>
                <li>Add adaptor for use with JXpath.</li>
                <li>Add contentChanged event to FileListener.</li>
                <li>Provide a hook for authentication.</li>
                <li>Sort out threading model.</li>
            </ul>
